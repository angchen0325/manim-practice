# Manim Practice

I decide to learn this famous math engine for precise programmatic animations: [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim). 
This wonderful engine have different versions:
 * [Manim, or ManimCE](https://www.manim.community) refers to the community maintained version of the library. And the package name on PyPI is [`manim`](https://pypi.org/project/manim/).
 * [ManimGL](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/index.html) is the latest released version of the version of the library developed by Grant Sanderson [`3b1b`](https://www.3blue1brown.com). It has more experimental features and breaking changes. Check out its documentation [here](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/index.html), and the package name on PyPI is [manimgl](https://pypi.org/project/manimgl/).
